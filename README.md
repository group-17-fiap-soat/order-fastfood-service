# üçî Tech Challenge - FastFood Backend API üçü

Welcome to the **FastFood Backend Service**! This Kotlin-powered backend is designed to handle all the core
functionalities of a FastFood management system. Hungry for some clean code and efficient API magic? Let‚Äôs get cooking!

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start Guide

This project is fueled by **Docker Compose** to quickly set up your PostgreSQL database environment. Below is a
breakdown of the environment variables you‚Äôll need to configure for database connectivity. To get started, create
a `.env` file by copying the structure provided in `.env.sample`.

| Variable            | Description                                                    |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DATABASE`          | The database name Docker Compose will create                   |
| `DATABASE_USER`     | The username for PostgreSQL authentication                     |
| `DATABASE_PASSWORD` | Password for your PostgreSQL user                              |
| `DATABASE_PORT`     | Host port for accessing PostgreSQL (default is usually `5432`) |

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

1. **Create Your Environment File**

   Duplicate the `.env.sample` file to create your personalized `.env` file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.sample .env
    ```

2. **Update Your Variables**

   Open up `.env` and customize it to your taste (or stick with the sample values!):

    ```plaintext
    DATABASE=db_example
    DATABASE_USER=user_example
    DATABASE_PASSWORD=password_example
    DATABASE_PORT=5432
    ```

3. **Create the Network**

   Before starting Docker Compose, create the network by running the following command:

    ```bash
    docker network create fastfood-network
    ```

4. **Start the Database with Docker Compose**

   Let Docker Compose do the heavy lifting. Fire up PostgreSQL with:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

5. **Build the Application Docker Image**

   To build the application Docker image, run the following command:

    ```bash
    docker build -t fastfood-app .
    ```

6. **Run the Application Docker Container**

   Once the image is built, run the Spring Boot application in a container:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env --network fastfood-network fastfood-app
    ```

7. **Check Your Connection**

   PostgreSQL should now be serving up data at `localhost:${DATABASE_PORT}`. Use the credentials in your `.env` to
   connect. The FastFood application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

## üîó Spring Boot Integration

The Spring Boot service will automatically pull in these environment variables to handle the database connection for
you. Just make sure that `.env` is in place and configured correctly, then let Spring Boot take care of the rest!

## üßë‚Äçüíª Swagger Documentation

Your FastFood API is documented with **Swagger UI**, providing a clean and interactive interface for exploring all
available endpoints.

To access the Swagger UI:

1. **Launch the Application** by running it through Docker as described above.
2. **Open Swagger UI** in your browser at:

   ```plaintext
   http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui
    ```

## üí° Pro Tips & Troubleshooting

- **Database Not Connecting?** Double-check that Docker Compose is up and running, and make sure PostgreSQL isn‚Äôt
  already running on the same port outside of Docker.
- **Environment Variables Not Loading?** Ensure your IDE or terminal session recognizes the `.env` file. If not, restart
  or source the `.env` file manually.

With that, you‚Äôre all set to start coding, deploying, and managing data like a pro. Welcome to FastFood, where speed
meets deliciously clean code. üçïüçü
